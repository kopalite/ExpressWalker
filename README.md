# ExpressWalker
ExpressWalker provides a generic way to examine and change any object graph in "Visitor Pattern" style. 
The target nodes can be specified manually or by type. Very handy for "unproxy" scenarios in ORM mappers
where you need an exact POCO copy of dynamically created proxy object. Fluent API is supported.
