# ExpressWalker
ExpressWalker provides a generic way to examine and change any object graph in "Visitor Pattern" style. 
The target nodes can be specified manually or by type. Comes very handy when using ORM tools (EF, NHibernate etc).
"Lazy-Load" mode creates dynamic proxy objects that can be very tough for serialiation. Fluent API is supported.
